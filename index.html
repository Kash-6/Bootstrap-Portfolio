                <p id="BioText">Hello, my name is Stefan Kashner. I currently reside where I was born and raised, in
                    Aston, Pennsylvania. I grew up as a die hard sports fan and tech junkie that spent most of my time
                    running around a field or playing games infront of a monitor. As I grew older, I slowly
                    transitioned from watching and/or participating in mainstream sports to training in mixed-martial
                    arts, specifically Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. This art became the most addicting hobby I've ever
                    experienced, infact I wouldn't even call it a hobby, it's more of a lifestyle. I have been training
                    now for seven years and teaching for two years. While I may have made a change in my sports
                    preferences, my tech habits have not changed as much. I still spend quite a bit of time infront of
                    that monitor, but now instead of playing games and having fun, I'm working to build a new career in
                    web development. I've always had a passion to work with computers, but never took the necessary
                    steps to make it happen, until now. I recently left my career as an HVAC technician to focus on
                    learning web development at Penn University in Philadelphia.</p>
